  Check ids are allocated using a specific formula - please follow it.
  
  All check ids are MVP, followed by a 4 digit number:         
                                                               MVPxxxx
  The first digit specifies the style of the rule  ═══════════════╝║╚╣
    1) Naming                                                      ║ ║
    2) Design                                                      ║ ║
                                                                   ║ ║
  The second digit specifies the target of the rule  ══════════════╝ ║
    1) Presenter                                                     ║
    2) View interface                                                ║
    3) View model                                                    ║

  The last two digits are just sequential, starting at 01  ══════════╝

    Under development:
    
    MVP1201 - View interface names should end with "View"
    MVP1301 - Types used as view models should end with "ViewModel"
    MVP2103 - Presenter constructors should all expose the view as the first argument and have it called "view"
    MVP2104 - Methods overriding Presenter<TView>.ReleaseView should contain a call to remove_* for all events that have a corresponding call to add_* in the constructor at the same level of the type hierarchy
    MVP2105 - Methods overriding Presenter<TView>.ReleaseView should not seal it (eg. public sealed override ReviewView(IView view) is bad)
    MVP2107 – Subscribing to view events should only be done in the presenter constructor
    MVP2201 - View types should be expressed as interfaces (ie. for Presenter<TView>, TView should be an interface)
    MVP2202 - View interfaces should not contain properties (properties should be moved to a view model)
    MVP2203 - View interfaces should not contain methods (method logic should be moved to presenters)
    MVP2204 - View interfaces should not contain indexers (properties should be moved to a view model)
    MVP2301 - Types used as view models should not contain methods
    MVP2302 - Types used as view models should not contain events
    MVP2303 - Types used as view models should not define custom constructors
